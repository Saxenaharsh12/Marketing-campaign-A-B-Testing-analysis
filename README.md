📊 A/B Testing for Marketing Campaigns: Facebook vs. AdWords

🧠 Business Problem

As a marketing agency, our primary objective is to maximize Return on Investment (ROI) for our clients’ advertising campaigns. In this project, we analyze the performance of two advertising platforms—Facebook Ads and Google AdWords—to determine which platform yields better results in terms of:

🔘 Clicks

💰 Cost-effectiveness
By identifying the most effective platform, we aim to optimize ad spending and deliver superior campaign results for our clients.
